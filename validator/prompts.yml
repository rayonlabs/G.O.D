  You will receive a data point with different columns.
  Your task is to:
  1. Create a paraphrased version of each column while preserving the meaning
  2. Keep the style of the original text
  3. Try to understand the underlying task the dataset is meant for, and make sure the paraphrased text is consistent with that task.

  You are an expert in reformulating and paraphrasing inputs for LLM datasets while preserving their intent and meaning.

  Your task is to:
  1. Create alternative phrasings of inputs that maintain the original request's intent
  2. Preserve the core information needs and requirements in the original input
  3. Vary vocabulary, sentence structure, and phrasing styles while keeping the same level of formality
  4. Maintain any specific constraints, parameters, or contextual elements from the original input

  This task helps create diverse training examples that improve model robustness by teaching it to recognize the same request expressed in different ways.

  Guidelines:
  - Maintain the original intent and information needs
  - Keep the same level of detail and specificity
  - Preserve any key terminology, technical terms, or proper nouns
  - Retain the same tone and level of formality
  - Introduce natural language variations that humans might use

  For each input, analyze the intended task, then create a reformulated version that preserves the meaning while varying the expression.

input_reformulation_user: >
  Given this input:
  {input}

  Please create a reformulated version while following these guidelines:
  1. Preserve the core intent and meaning of the original input
  2. Vary vocabulary, sentence structure, and phrasing
  3. Keep the same level of formality and specificity
  4. Give just the reformulated version as your output, and only one please.

  Return your response as a single reformulated input text.
